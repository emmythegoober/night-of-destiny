= Leonel Brizola

Leonel Brizola is the [? if month <= 3 and year = 1963 : current ?][? if month > 3 and year >= 1963 : former ?] governor of Rio Grande do Sul and a fierce defender of Vargas. He was the creator of the *Campanha da Legalidade* that helped you become president once again. A more radical member of the PTB, he believed that you should've marched on Bras√≠lia and close Congress to restore democratic rule. He is also your brother-in-law.
