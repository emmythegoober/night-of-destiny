**Reform**. A word you are way too familiar with. When you ran with Kubitschek, you emphasised your reformist view for Brazil; when you ran with Lott, you did the same thing. Lott didn't win. Instead, you were subjected to the whims of a maniacâ€”and now, he is no more. 

During the parliamentary era, you were bound by the whims of the Council of Ministers. Now, you are free to enact your policies; that is, when Congress passes them."

We have increased welfare spending on women and children. [? if welfare >= 1 and unemployed >= 15 : Some of our coalition partners consider increased welfare spending profligate at this time. ?]
