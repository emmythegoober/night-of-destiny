**Reform**. A word you are way too familiar with. When you ran with Kubitschek, you emphasised your reformist view for Brazil; when you ran with Lott, you did the same thing. But Lott didn't win and you were subjugated to the whims of a maniacâ€”but Quadros is no more. 

The **Reformas de Base** have been in the works since 1961. During the parliamentary era, you were bound by the whims of the Council of Ministers, now you are free to enact your policies. Most of them need to get passed by Congress.

We have increased welfare spending on women and children. [? if welfare >= 1 and unemployed >= 15 : Some of our coalition partners consider increased welfare spending profligate at this time. ?]
