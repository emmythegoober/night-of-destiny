= Reformas de Base

{! <center><img src="img/flavor/ReformasJango.jpg"></center> !}

**Reform**. A word you are way too familiar with. When you ran with Kubitschek, you emphasised your reformist view for Brazil; when you ran with Lott, you did the same thing. But Lott didn't win and you were subjugated to the whims of a maniacâ€”but Quadros is no more. 

The **Reformas de Base** have been in the works since 1961. During the parliamentary era, you were bound by the whims of the Council of Ministers, now you are free to enact your policies. Most of them need to get passed by Congress.

We have reduced levels of social welfare spending. This means more poverty and suffering for the working class. Our detractors claim that we are sacrificing proletarian livelihoods for the sake of class peace with the bourgeoisie. Are they wrong? Are the workers wrong to turn to the Communists, in light of our choices?
